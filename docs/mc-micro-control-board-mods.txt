. add decoupling cap on output of reg on underside of board to replace
  the tantalum one removed.
. disable watchdog. Ground IC601 pin 13 (non inverting input)
. remove link a-b if fitted
. remove ju711 and ju709 next to 9 pin d type
. remove vr656 and vr654
. fit link j-k ext alarm open collector output next to shift reg at edge of board. consider using fuse wire here.
. fit ext alarm components for switching linear etc. using another board
  as a reference

audio path mods
. remove c608 33nF cap above L601
. consider 220k between pin 3 and pin 5 U601
. cut link EF between shift register and transistor array which links
. consider JU601 Flat Tx Audio
  pin 6 of 9 pin dtype for mic and 15 pin d type and Q601

15 pin d type modes
. configure pin 1 as open collector output - remove R768. This is
  in the middle of the board almost in line with the through
  connector but slightly nearer 9 pin d type end of board. Reconfigure
  base input to be like EXT ALARM - 470 ohm series resistance on base.
. configure pin 9 (Tx/Rx) as open collector output - remove R767 - pin 31 on
  microcontroller is base/input connection
. configure pin 15 (CSQ) as open collector output - remove R733, fit JU703,
  remove JU 704 - pin 12 on microcontroller is base/input connection.
  Consider replacing Q711 with MOSFET with fuse wire on drain to protect
  open drain configuration (very low on resistance).
